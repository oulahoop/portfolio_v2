# Portfolio (v2.0)

## Description
This is my personal portfolio website. It is a single page application that showcases my projects, skills, experiences and contact information in French. The website is built using Nuxt (Vue) to train me because I like this framework and I wanted to try it myself.

## Technologies
- Nuxt.js
